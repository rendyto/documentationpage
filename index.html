          The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (<a
            class="external-link"
            href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox/"
            >a W3C Candidate Recommendation</a
          >
          as of October 2017) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out,
          align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their
          size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).
        </p>
        <p>
          The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the
          ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the
          available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices
          and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available
          free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed
          to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline
          which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they
          lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex
          applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing,
          resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the
          components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid
          layout is intended for larger scale layouts.

          <h3>Basic and terminology</h3>
        </header>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves
          a lot of things including its whole set of properties. Some of them
          are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as “flex
          container”) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children
          (said “flex items”).
        </p>
        <p>
          If “regular” layout is based on both block and inline flow directions,
          the flex layout is based on “flex-flow directions”. Please have a look
          at this figure from the specification, explaining the main idea behind
          the flex layout.

        <p>
          Items will be laid out following either the main axis (from main-start
          to main-end) or the cross axis (from cross-start to cross-end).
          <ul>
              <li> 
                <strong>main axis</strong> – The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flex-direction property (see below).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>main-start | main-end</strong> – The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>main size</strong> – A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size. The flex item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’ property, whichever is in the main dimension.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>cross axis</strong> – The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.
              </li>
              <li>
                  <strong>cross-start | cross-end </strong> – Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.
              </li>
              <li>
                  <strong>cross size</strong> – The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. The cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in the cross dimension.
              </li>
          </ul>

                        <li>space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.</li>
                        <li>space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Note that that browser support for these values is nuanced. For example, space-between never got support from some versions of Edge, and start/end/left/right aren’t in Chrome yet. MDN <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content">has detailed charts</a> . The safest values are flex-start, flex-end, and center.</p>
                    <p>There are also two additional keywords you can pair with these values: safe and unsafe. Using safe ensures that however you do this type of positioning, you can’t push an element such that it renders off-screen (e.g. off the top) in such a way the content can’t be scrolled too (called “data loss”).</p>

The auto keyword means “look at my width or height property” (which was temporarily done by the main-size keyword until deprecated). The content keyword means “size it based on the item’s content” – this keyword isn’t well supported yet, so it’s hard to test and harder to know what its brethren max-content, min-content, and fit-content do.</p>

          <h3>Prefixing flexbox</h3>
        </header>
        <hr />
        <p>Flexbox requires some vendor prefixing to support the most browsers possible. It doesn’t just include prepending properties with the vendor prefix, but there are actually entirely different property and value names. This is because the Flexbox spec has changed over time, creating an <a href="https://css-tricks.com/old-flexbox-and-new-flexbox/">“old”, “tweener”, and “new” versions.</a></p>
        <p>Perhaps the best way to handle this is to write in the new (and final) syntax and run your CSS through<a href="https://css-tricks.com/autoprefixer/">Autoprefixer</a> , which handles the fallbacks very well.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, here’s a Sass @mixin to help with some of the prefixing, which also gives you an idea of what kind of things need to be done:</p>
        <pre class="prettytype lang.css">
            <code>
                @mixin flexbox() {
                    display: -webkit-box;
                    display: -moz-box;
                    display: -ms-flexbox;
                    display: -webkit-flex;
                    display: flex;
                  }
                  
                  @mixin flex($values) {
                    -webkit-box-flex: $values;
                    -moz-box-flex:  $values;
                    -webkit-flex:  $values;

                    flex:  $values;
                  }
                  
                  @mixin order($val) {
                    -webkit-box-ordinal-group: $val;  
                    -moz-box-ordinal-group: $val;     
                    -ms-flex-order: $val;     
                    -webkit-order: $val;  
                    order: $val;
                  }
                  
                  .wrapper {
                    @include flexbox();
                  }
                  
                  .item {
